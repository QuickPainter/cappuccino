## Background

This directory contains a Python-based pipeline for processing and analyzing large amounts of GBT data to search for radio technosignatures. For a more detailed overview of the search for radio technosignatures, please see the [@UCBerkeleySETI] page, [here](https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/breakthrough/tree/master/GBT).  

As noted in the introductory materials, the basics of searching for signatures of extraterrestrial technology are actually quite simple, but the confounding factors are:

Human technology gives off signals like the ones we are looking for (radio frequency interference)
Data volumes are too large to run brute force analysis on the whole dataset
Here's how we deal with these problems:




# Walkthrough

## Setup

This code is meant to be run on data from Berkeley's Breakthrough Listen group, and is most easily run on the Breakthrough Listen computer clusters. It is possible to download the data files you want locally though, and run it on your machine. All that is needed is a basic python environment.
