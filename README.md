## Background

This directory contains a Python-based pipeline for processing and analyzing large amounts of GBT data to search for radio technosignatures.


# Walkthrough

## Setup

This code is meant to be run on data from Berkeley's Breakthrough Listen group, and is most easily run on the Breakthrough Listen computer clusters. It is possible to download the data files you want locally though, and run it on your machine. All that is needed is a basic python environment.
